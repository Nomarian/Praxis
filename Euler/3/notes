primefactor
 should use primefiller
 that is, isprime but it actually fills the list with primes until you get
 a hit on a limit.
 primeposdb(n) uses normal primepos and fills it but checks the db first
 so its if #primes<n then return primes[n] end
 while primepos()
 the problem is primefill edits out the primes list...
 return true false as a secondary item, true if primes list has been filled
 NO, return number of items added to list
